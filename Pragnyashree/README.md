DATA PRE-PROCESSING

1. Since the dataset has missing reviews for rating 5 and 6, I am working on retrieving those data from IMDB website using BeautifulSoup and IMDB API. This task is in progress.
2. Steps involved in cleaning the data: [Libraries used: nltk and pandas]
	o	Removing HTML tags like <br> using regex from the reviews
	o	Removing words with numbers
	o	Sentence tokenization for generating proper bigrams for negation features like “not good”
	o	Word tokenization of the entire review text by ignoring punctuations.
	o	Removing stop words from the tokenized words.
	o	Lemmatization on the tokenized words without stop words.
