You will hear dialog that makes this logical..<br /><br />Steven Weber (Wings) is our politician,his role is slightly vague,this is another point for the audience to ponder<br /><br />Alex D.Linz is our 15 year old, He was about 17 when they made this movie, but easily can pass for younger. He has been in films & TV since he was a young child, He is a very good actor & is quite convincing.<br /><br />Escher Holloway is the older teen, This role is his first major part & he too is excellent.<br /><br />Now I am saving the best for last, the writer/director,<br /><br />Luke Eberl is not yet 23 years old. For a first effort a big thumbs up. I do hope he as well as our 2 lads have a long career.<br /><br />Ratings: *** (out of 4) 86 points(out of 100) IMDb 8 (out of 10)\n"
